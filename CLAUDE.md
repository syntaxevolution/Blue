## Project: CashWars Reimagined

A modern remake of the classic ~2001 browser game **CashWars** (set on the fictional oil world of **Akzar**). Persistent-world, turn-limited strategy game where players explore a fog-of-war grid, drill oil, upgrade four balanced stats, spy on and raid rival bases for virtual currency, and form alliances.

**Virtual currency only** — no real money, no play-to-earn. The original died because combat RNG was too flat and ad-farming bots destroyed the economy. We are fixing both.

---

## Required Reading (in this order)

Before doing ANY work on this project, read these three files in the project root:

1. **`ultraplan.md`** — Master reference. Elevator pitch, what-stays/changes/goes, locked parameters, locked tech stack, build phases, glossary.
2. **`gameplay-ultraplan.md`** — Locked gameplay and world design (v1.0). Stats, combat rules, map, fog of war, shops, MDNs, drill mechanics, economy, seasons, onboarding.
3. **`technical-ultraplan.md`** — Full technical architecture (v0.1). Stack, DB schema, domain services, config system, RNG service, API design, deployment, anti-abuse, v1 launch checklist.

**Do not start implementation work without reading all three.** The specs are dense but tight — everything you need is in them.

---

## Tech Stack (locked)

- **Backend:** Laravel 11, PHP 8.3+, MySQL 8, Redis 7
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 (Composition API) + Inertia.js (SPA mode) + Tailwind CSS + Pinia (UI state only) + Vite
- **Real-time:** Laravel Reverb (fallback: Pusher free tier)
- **Queues:** Laravel Horizon
- **Auth:** Fortify (email/pass) + Socialite (Google, Discord, Apple) + Sanctum (mobile API tokens)
- **Admin:** Filament
- **Bot defense:** Cloudflare Turnstile
- **Email:** Resend or Postmark (TBD)
- **Testing:** Pest

---

## Environment

- **Development machine:** Windows (use Write/Read tools for file ops, avoid Linux-only shell commands)
- **Production server:** Debian stable VPS running **DirectAdmin**, shared with other side projects
  - Will migrate to dedicated VPS if the game succeeds
  - Nginx, Supervisor, Let's Encrypt SSL
  - Manual deploy via `git pull` + shell script, no CI/CD
- **Target launch size:** ~100 users
- **Local dev preference (leaning):** Laravel Herd for Windows

---

## Core Architectural Principles

1. **Configurability is a product feature.** Every balance number, cost, cooldown, RNG range, and probability lives in config (`config/game.php` defaults + `game_settings` DB table overrides), accessed via a `GameConfig` facade. **Never hardcode a balance value.** Tuning the game must never require a deployment.
2. **Seeded RNG via `RngService`.** Every random roll goes through the service. It supports record mode (for dispute audits), replay mode (for deterministic tests), and configurable PRNG sources.
3. **Dual-layer controllers, shared domain.** `app/Http/Controllers/Web/*` for Inertia, `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/*` for REST (future mobile). Both are thin and call the same `app/Domain/*` services. All game logic lives in the domain layer, which is pure PHP and fully testable.
4. **Lazy state reconciliation.** Move regen and oil field regen compute on-read, not via global ticking jobs. Zero drift.
5. **Single-VPS sanity.** Everything fits on one box for 100 users. No microservices, no K8s, no distributed anything.

---

## Locked Gameplay Parameters (quick reference)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Stats | Strength, Fortification, Stealth, Security |
| Stat hard cap / soft plateau | 25 / starts at 15 |
| Drill grid per oil field | 5×5 (25 points) |
| Loot ceiling per raid | 20% |
| Cash floor | None (players can be robbed to zero) |
| Bankruptcy pity stipend | A0.25, once per event |
| New player immunity | 48 hours from signup |
| Spy intel decay | 24 hours |
| Intel decay | 1% per day |
| Intel value anchor | 1 Intel ≈ 5 barrels |
| MDN size cap | 50 |
| Same-MDN attacks | Blocked |
| MDN formal alliances | Declarative UI only |
| Raid cooldown per target | 12 hours per attacker |
| Combat formula | Deterministic + ±10–15% RNG |
| Season model | Soft monthly, no resets, cosmetic rewards |
| Starting cash / stats / drill | A5.00 / Str 1 others 0 / Dentist Drill |
| Daily move regen | ~200 (configurable) |

**Every single one of these is a config key — tune, don't hardcode.**

## Build Phases

1. **Phase 0 — Foundations:** Laravel project, auth, `GameConfig`, `RngService`, admin panel skeleton
2. **Phase 1 — World & Movement:** tiles, fog of war, spawn, travel
3. **Phase 2 — Economy:** oil fields with 5×5 drill grids, posts, shops, items, currencies
4. **Phase 3 — Combat:** spy, attack, CombatFormula, bankruptcy, notifications
5. **Phase 4 — Social:** MDNs, shared journal, alliances
6. **Phase 5 — Progression & Polish:** leaderboards, seasons, world growth, auctions, tutorial
7. **Phase 6 — Launch Prep:** anti-abuse, load test, deploy script, docs, beta

See `ultraplan.md` §7 for details.

---

## Current State

**Planning complete. No code written yet.**

All three Ultraplan docs are finalized and locked. The next step is **Phase 0 — Foundations**: bootstrap the Laravel project.

### Open decisions to resolve at start of Phase 0
(From `technical-ultraplan.md` §20)

1. Laravel Herd vs Sail for Windows local dev — **leaning Herd**
2. Filament vs custom admin — **leaning Filament**
3. Resend vs Postmark for email — **leaning Resend**
4. Disposable email blocklist source
5. Scheduler via `schedule:work` vs cron — **leaning cron on DirectAdmin**

None are blockers; can be resolved inline while bootstrapping.

---

## Working Rules for Claude Code on This Project

1. **Always read the three Ultraplan docs before any work.** Scope and decisions live there.
2. **Never hardcode a balance value.** If you find yourself typing `5` or `0.2` into game logic, stop and add a config key instead.
3. **All RNG through `RngService`.** No direct `rand()` or `random_int()` calls in game logic.
4. **Domain logic goes in `app/Domain/*`, never in controllers.** Controllers are thin; services are pure.
5. **Web and API must stay in sync.** When adding a new action, add both the Inertia controller and the `/api/v1/*` REST controller, and put the logic in a shared service.
6. **Windows dev machine.** Use Write/Read tools for files. Shell commands should work on Windows (cmd or git-bash). Avoid Linux-only syntax unless SSH'd into the prod server.
7. **No CI/CD.** Deployment is manual via `git pull` + shell script on the Debian VPS.
8. **Target is 100 users on a shared VPS.** Don't over-engineer for scale we don't have yet.
9. **Ask before making architectural changes** to the locked stack or the locked gameplay parameters. Minor tuning is expected; structural changes need sign-off.
10. **Keep the Ultraplan docs in sync.** If a decision changes during implementation, update the relevant doc so the master spec stays authoritative.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `laravel-best-practices` — Apply this skill whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring Laravel PHP code. This includes creating or modifying controllers, models, migrations, form requests, policies, jobs, scheduled commands, service classes, and Eloquent queries. Triggers for N+1 and query performance issues, caching strategies, authorization and security patterns, validation, error handling, queue and job configuration, route definitions, and architectural decisions. Also use for Laravel code reviews and refactoring existing Laravel code to follow best practices. Covers any task involving Laravel backend PHP code patterns.
- `pest-testing` — Use this skill for Pest PHP testing in Laravel projects only. Trigger whenever any test is being written, edited, fixed, or refactored — including fixing tests that broke after a code change, adding assertions, converting PHPUnit to Pest, adding datasets, and TDD workflows. Always activate when the user asks how to write something in Pest, mentions test files or directories (tests/Feature, tests/Unit, tests/Browser), or needs browser testing, smoke testing multiple pages for JS errors, or architecture tests. Covers: test()/it()/expect() syntax, datasets, mocking, browser testing (visit/click/fill), smoke testing, arch(), Livewire component tests, RefreshDatabase, and all Pest 4 features. Do not use for factories, seeders, migrations, controllers, models, or non-test PHP code.
- `inertia-vue-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 Vue client-side applications. Activates when creating Vue pages, forms, or navigation; using <Link>, <Form>, useForm, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions Vue with Inertia, Vue pages, Vue forms, or Vue navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Always invoke when the user's message includes 'tailwind' in any form. Also invoke for: building responsive grid layouts (multi-column card grids, product grids), flex/grid page structures (dashboards with sidebars, fixed topbars, mobile-toggle navs), styling UI components (cards, tables, navbars, pricing sections, forms, inputs, badges), adding dark mode variants, fixing spacing or typography, and Tailwind v3/v4 work. The core use case: writing or fixing Tailwind utility classes in HTML templates (Blade, JSX, Vue). Skip for backend PHP logic, database queries, API routes, JavaScript with no HTML/CSS component, CSS file audits, build tool configuration, and vanilla CSS.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/Pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== laravel/v11 rules ===

# Laravel 11

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Laravel 11 brought a new streamlined file structure which this project now uses.

## Laravel 11 Structure

- In Laravel 11, middleware are no longer registered in `app\Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- No app\Console\Kernel.php - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Commands auto-register - files in `app\Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

## New Artisan Commands

- List Artisan commands using Boost's MCP tool, if available. New commands available in Laravel 11:
    - `php artisan make:enum`
    - `php artisan make:class`
    - `php artisan make:interface`

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

# Inertia + Vue

Vue components must have a single root element.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application, check how and where to follow existing application conventions.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel. It allows developers to define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. It is built on top of Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get information from the official Filament documentation when needed. This is very useful for Artisan command arguments, specific code examples, testing functionality, relationship management, and ensuring you're following idiomatic practices.
- Utilize static `make()` methods for consistent component initialization.

### Artisan

- You must use the Filament specific Artisan commands to create new files or components for Filament. You can find these with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or with `php artisan` and the `--help` option.
- Inspect the required options, always pass `--no-interaction`, and valid arguments for other options when applicable.

### Filament's Core Features

- Actions: Handle doing something within the application, often with a button or link. Actions encapsulate the UI, the interactive modal window, and the logic that should be executed when the modal window is submitted. They can be used anywhere in the UI and are commonly used to perform one-time actions like deleting a record, sending an email, or updating data in the database based on modal form input.
- Forms: Dynamic forms rendered within other features, such as resources, action modals, table filters, and more.
- Infolists: Read-only lists of data.
- Notifications: Flash notifications displayed to users within the application.
- Panels: The top-level container in Filament that can include all other features like pages, resources, forms, tables, notifications, actions, infolists, and widgets.
- Resources: Static classes that are used to build CRUD interfaces for Eloquent models. Typically live in `app/Filament/Resources`.
- Schemas: Represent components that define the structure and behavior of the UI, such as forms, tables, or lists.
- Tables: Interactive tables with filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
- Widgets: Small component included within dashboards, often used for displaying data in charts, tables, or as a stat.

### Relationships

- Determine if you can use the `relationship()` method on form components when you need `options` for a select, checkbox, repeater, or when building a `Fieldset`:

<code-snippet name="Relationship example for Form Select" lang="php">
Forms\Components\Select::make('user_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->relationship('author')
    ->required(),
</code-snippet>

## Testing

- It's important to test Filament functionality for user satisfaction.
- Ensure that you are authenticated to access the application within the test.
- Filament uses Livewire, so start assertions with `livewire()` or `Livewire::test()`.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Filament Table Test" lang="php">
    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1))
        ->searchTable($users->last()->email)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(-1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->take($users->count() - 1));
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Filament Create Resource Test" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => 'Howdy',
            'email' => 'howdy@example.com',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => 'Howdy',
        'email' => 'howdy@example.com',
    ]);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Multiple Panels (setup())" lang="php">
    use Filament\Facades\Filament;

    Filament::setCurrentPanel('app');
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling an Action in a Test" lang="php">
    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])->callAction('send');

    expect($invoice->refresh())->isSent()->toBeTrue();
</code-snippet>

## Version 3 Changes To Focus On

- Resources are located in `app/Filament/Resources/` directory.
- Resource pages (List, Create, Edit) are auto-generated within the resource's directory - e.g., `app/Filament/Resources/PostResource/Pages/`.
- Forms use the `Forms\Components` namespace for form fields.
- Tables use the `Tables\Columns` namespace for table columns.
- A new `Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor` component is available.
- Form and table schemas now use fluent method chaining.
- Added `php artisan filament:optimize` command for production optimization.
- Requires implementing `FilamentUser` contract for production access control.
